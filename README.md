1. The Main File is AI.py . This is the python file you want to execute.
2. You might have to install certain import files otherwise it will give error
3. Once the message has been sent to the first name ( the process has begun ) if you were stop the program in the middle, a new file ( the name of this file is a random number which corresponds to the people that have already been messaged ) will appear in the ROOT FOLDER / MAIN FOLDER which will hold the names of the people who have not been messaged ( the names of people who have already been messaged won't be available in the list ). What you want to do is go in AI.py and find the part of code which takes names of people as input, and change the source of input to this new file so that when you begin the program again, it won't dm the same people. Honestly I could have made the code more optimized  this is my work you should not have to go through all this but imagine if I started giving fucks about my youtube audience mwhaahahahaha bitch shut up subscribe and know your place.
